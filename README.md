⭐ Superhero Image Classification App (MATLAB + GoogLeNet)

This project is a MATLAB App Designer application that classifies superhero images like Spiderman, Hulk, and Black Widow using transfer learning with the pretrained GoogLeNet convolutional neural network.

The app provides a simple GUI that lets you:

-> Train a custom classifier

-> Upload an image

-> Classify it with a single click

-> View the image directly in the UI

This is a complete end-to-end MATLAB deep learning demo suitable for learning, teaching, and showcasing on GitHub.
